    "### When to Use Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building multi-agent systems, ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"Do I really need several specialized dynamic reasoning machines collaborating to solve this task more effectively than a single agent could?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent systems are useful when:\n",
    "1. **Tool/responsibility grouping**: Different tasks require different expertise\n",
    "2. **Prompt separation**: Different agents need different instructions/few-shot examples\n",
    "3. **Piecewise optimization**: Easier to improve individual components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Multi-Agent Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Description | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Supervisor** | Central orchestrator routes to specialist agents | Task delegation, quality control |\n",
    "| **Handoffs** | Agents transfer control to each other | Conversation flows, expertise routing |\n",
    "| **Hierarchical** | Supervisors manage teams of agents | Large-scale systems, departments |\n",
    "| **Network/Swarm** | Agents communicate freely | Collaborative problem-solving |\n",

    "### Context Engineering Principles\n",

    "- **Dex Horthy (12-Factor Agents)**: \"Own your context window and treat it like prime real estate\"\n",

      "### Latest Developments in Alternative Investments\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Partnerships Between Insurers and Alternative Investment Firms**: Liberty Mutual Group's asset-management arm has partnered with Ara Partners to support infrastructure and energy strategies. This collaboration includes significant commitments to Ara's new energy fund and existing investments. Such partnerships are becoming more common as insurers seek to diversify their portfolios through alternative investments, particularly in energy infrastructure, which includes renewable power and digital infrastructure (Insurance Journal, 2026).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Growth in Private Credit**: Apollo Global Management is focusing on expanding its private credit operations, emphasizing its ability to manufacture and distribute credit across various channels, including insurance and wealth management. This strategy aims to tap into the growing demand for private market investments, particularly from defined contribution plans and advisor-led allocations. Apollo's model is being seen as a blueprint for others in the industry, highlighting the maturation of private credit as a significant investment ecosystem (HedgeCo.Net, 2026).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technological Integration in Private Markets**: The private markets are increasingly adopting technology to streamline data collection and reporting for investors. This shift is essential for meeting the diverse reporting demands of sophisticated investors and enhancing operational efficiency within investment firms (Private Equity Wire, 2026).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Latest Developments in Risk Management\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **AI-Driven Risk Management Solutions**: Lema AI, a startup focused on third-party risk management, has raised $24 million to develop an AI-powered platform that automates vendor risk assessments. This technology aims to replace traditional manual processes with continuous, data-driven analysis, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of risk management in supply chains (SecurityWeek, 2026).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **AI Risk Management Framework**: There is ongoing discussion about maintaining the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework, which provides guidelines for the safe deployment of AI technologies. Industry groups are advocating for the framework to remain intact, emphasizing its importance in managing AI-related risks (Axios, 2026).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhanced Risk Analytics for Insurance**: ZestyAI has partnered with Marsh McLennan Agency to provide AI-driven risk analytics for high-net-worth clients, particularly those with properties in catastrophe-prone areas. This collaboration aims to improve risk assessments and offer tailored insurance solutions, reflecting a trend towards more sophisticated risk management practices in the insurance sector (Insurance Journal, 2026).\n",
      "\n",
      "These developments indicate a growing integration of technology in both alternative investments and risk management, as firms seek to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability in a rapidly changing market environment.\n"

    "## Question #1:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Supervisor pattern, the supervisor routes requests to specialist agents. What are the **advantages** and **disadvantages** of having agents loop back to the supervisor after responding, versus having them respond directly to the user? Consider this in the context of an investment advisory system where accuracy is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of looping back to supervisor:**\n",
    "- **Quality control and validation** - The supervisor can review specialist responses before they reach the user, ensuring accuracy which is critical for investment advice\n",
    "- **Response aggregation** - The supervisor can combine inputs from multiple specialists or request clarifications when needed\n",
    "- **Consistency** - Ensures all responses follow the same format and quality standards before reaching the user\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of looping back to supervisor:**\n",
    "- **Increased latency** - Additional processing step delays the response to the user\n",
    "- **Higher token costs** - More LLM calls (supervisor review + specialist response) increase computational expenses\n",
    "- **Added complexity** - More potential points of failure in the system architecture\n",
    "- **Token consumption** - The supervisor needs to process the full specialist response, consuming more context window\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the investment advisory context:**\n",
    "Given that accuracy is critical for financial advice, the current implementation (specialists respond directly to END) prioritizes speed and cost-efficiency over additional validation. However, for an investment advisory system where incorrect information could have serious financial consequences, looping back to the supervisor would likely be worth the trade-offs to ensure response accuracy and consistency before reaching clients."

    "## Question #2:\n",

    "We added Tavily web search alongside the investment knowledge base. In what scenarios would you want to **restrict** an agent to only use the knowledge base (no web search)? What are the trade-offs between freshness and reliability when providing investment information?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios to restrict web search:**\n",
    "- **Client-specific information** - Prevent client proprietary data from being sent to external web search APIs\n",
    "- **Confidential strategy details** - Avoid exposing internal investment methodologies or positions to third-party services\n",
    "- **Regulatory compliance** - Ensure sensitive financial information remains within controlled systems\n",
    "- **Supervisor coordination** - Prevent supervisors from inadvertently passing non-public information to web search tools when routing between agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs between freshness and reliability:**\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Knowledge base provides vetted, accurate Stone Ridge-specific information but may be outdated\n",
    "- **Freshness**: Web search offers current market data and news but introduces potential misinformation and unverified sources\n",
    "- **Cost**: Web search adds API costs and latency compared to local knowledge base queries\n",
    "- **Control**: Knowledge base ensures consistent, brand-aligned responses while web search introduces external content variability"

    "\n",
    "Build a **Hierarchical Agent System** where a top-level supervisor manages multiple team supervisors, each with their own specialist agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an **Investment Director** (top-level supervisor using GPT-5.2) that:\n",
    "   - Receives user questions and determines which team should handle it\n",
    "   - Routes to either the \"Markets Team\" or \"Strategy Team\"\n",
    "   - Aggregates final responses from teams\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create two **Team Supervisors**:\n",
    "   - **Markets Team Lead**: Manages Market Outlook Agent and Performance Analysis Agent\n",
    "   - **Strategy Team Lead**: Manages Investment Strategy Agent and Risk Management Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement the hierarchical routing:\n",
    "   - User question -> Investment Director -> Team Lead -> Specialist Agent -> Response\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test with questions that require different teams:\n",
    "   - \"What is Stone Ridge's view on the current market environment?\" (Markets team)\n",
    "   - \"How does Stone Ridge manage tail risk in its portfolios?\" (Strategy team)\n",

    "\n",
    "In this module, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understood Multi-Agent Systems**: When to use them and key patterns\n",
    "2. **Built a Supervisor Pattern**: Central orchestrator routing to investment specialists\n",
    "3. **Implemented Agent Handoffs**: Investment agents transferring control to each other\n",
    "4. **Added Web Search**: Tavily for current market data alongside the Stone Ridge knowledge base\n",
    "5. **Applied Context Engineering**: Managing context for optimal performance with financial information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don't over-engineer**: Only add agents when you truly need specialization\n",
    "- **Context is key**: Manage your context window carefully, especially with dense financial data\n",
    "- **Patterns matter**: Choose the right pattern for your investment advisory use case\n",
