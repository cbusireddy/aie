    "\n",
    "Before diving into agents, let's understand the fundamental building blocks of LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Runnable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Runnable** is the core abstraction in LangChain - think of it as a standardized component that:\n",
    "- Takes an input\n",
    "- Performs some operation\n",
    "- Returns an output\n",
    "\n",
    "Every component in LangChain (models, prompts, retrievers, parsers) is a Runnable, which means they all share the same interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = runnable.invoke(input)           # Single input\n",
    "results = runnable.batch([input1, input2]) # Multiple inputs\n",
    "for chunk in runnable.stream(input):       # Streaming\n",
    "    print(chunk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL** allows you to chain Runnables together using the `|` (pipe) operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | model | output_parser\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"query\": \"Hello!\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to Unix pipes - the output of one component becomes the input to the next."
